# Azure-Infrastructure-As-A-Code
As part of my internship program at Investec, I have been involved in many deployments using IaaC, ARM Templates, and Bicep Templates.

In this repo, I'll be working on deploying a hello world ASP.NET API in a container using Infrastructure-as-a-Code.

The focus is on IaaC with Microsoft Azure
